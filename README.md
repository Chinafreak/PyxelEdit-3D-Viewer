# PyxelEdit 3D Viewer
With PyxelEdit: 3D Viewer, you can display 2D sprites from pyxel edit on fake 3D. The viewer update only the files if you saved the Pyxel Edit files (Strg+S). 
There is many settings like set to pixelated, fix edges (while you're scaling up), pin the window (so the window show on foreground for ever), etc.


### Features:

  - Pixelated or Shape Modus:

  - Or even export rotating sprite into sprite sheet! (So you can draw directly from sprite sheet instead draw single of layers on your game, it's better for performance!)

  - And all thanks to YoYoGames for their beatiful software called "Game Maker: Studio"!

### Additional Information:

### Function Wanted:

  - Like I said, there is a option to export to 3D files (.obj files), but I don't know how to optimize the 3d object. I hope someone could help me this
  - More file support such like aseprite, gimp, photoshop etc.
